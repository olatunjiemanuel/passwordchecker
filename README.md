# React-Native-Password-Checker
This is a side project extracted from one of my main projects
It is a simple and reusable password checker
Based on the input entered by the user, it checks for :
Minimum 8 characters,
One uppercase and lowercase character,
Numbers and
One special character.
It also has a show/hide password button which controls the state of the text input (i.e if it is shown or not).
The UI is made as simple as possible so it can be reused without any difficulties.
This side project helped me practice useState write cleaner code using components and passing props to those components.
Please see below video to see what how the code runs via expo:
